Description:

    Inspired by http://placehold.it.
    
    Generates placeholder images for web pages in development but
    does not require an active Internet connection.
    
    Requires the Python Imaging Library.

Usage:
    
    Run the script in a terminal.
    
    Point the web browser or img src to
    http://localhost:5001/(width)x(height) or
    http://localhost:5001/(width)x(height)/(colour hex code)
    
    For example:
    <img src="http://localhost:5001/800x600" alt="Placeholder." />
    <img src="http://localhost:5001/800x600/a4b5c6" alt="Placeholder." />
